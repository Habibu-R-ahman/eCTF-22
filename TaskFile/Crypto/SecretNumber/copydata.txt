Neha's teacher puts the answer in the code and makes things a little too easy. She is given a smart contract which takes 0.1 eth for each guess. This time Teacher has only stored the hash of the number. Good luck reversing a cryptographic hash!

For the flag,calculate the first 15 characters from hash of the secret number when expressed in words

Ex: 111=onehundredeleven is to be hashed

Flag format: CTF{...}
